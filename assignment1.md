[Despite Voting Restoration Thousands Are Still Disenfranchised In The Ohio Valley](https://ohiovalleyresource.org/2020/12/04/despite-voting-restoration-thousands-are-still-disenfranchised-in-the-ohio-valley)

- Clarity and Accuracy: 4/5
  - The written data within the article itself is presented thoughtfully although it may overwhelm some reaaders. Ultimately it helped highlight the massive number of former felons (many reformed) who have been stripped of their constitutional right to vote.
  - The headline mentions the thousands of disenfranchised voters, but fails to mention that the article focuses on ex felons.
- Data Visualization: 2/5
  - The graphics felt clumsy and unfinished. The point of the article was to highlight the demonstrably huge number of people who have lost the right to vote, but the graphic meant to communicate that minimized it instead of highlighting it.
