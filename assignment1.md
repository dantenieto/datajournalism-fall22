[Despite Voting Restoration Thousands Are Still Disenfranchised In The Ohio Valley](https://ohiovalleyresource.org/2020/12/04/despite-voting-restoration-thousands-are-still-disenfranchised-in-the-ohio-valley) 

By Alana Watson

- Clarity and Accuracy: 4/5
  - The written data within the article itself is presented thoughtfully although it may overwhelm some reaaders. Ultimately it helped highlight the massive number of former felons (many reformed) who have been stripped of their constitutional right to vote.
  - The headline mentions the thousands of disenfranchised voters, but fails to mention that the article focuses on ex felons.

- Data Visualization: 2/5
  - The graphics felt clumsy and unfinished. The point of the article was to highlight the demonstrably huge number of people who have lost the right to vote, but the graphic meant to communicate that (the stacks of 100 squares) minimized it instead of highlighting it. The circular graphic that compared disenfranchisement in all fifty states was interesting. However, didn't provide the reader with any numbers. 
  - The square graphic could be substituted with a bar graph containing the raw numbers and not percentages. The circular graph should have been replaced with some sort of heat map.

- Accuracy - ?
  - It's difficult to speak to the accuracy of this article. Some of the sources cited do not actually contain the information she presents. I may have missed it, but I scowered her main source's website, and couldn't find many matches.

- Quality - 2/5
  - There were ways to visualize the data the author presents that would have given the story the weight it deserved. That said, the story was well written and effectively communicates the severity of the issue. The anecdotal aspect that sets up the whole story was a good lead-in and helped give disenfranchisement a face.

- Types and Color
  - The circular charts felt disjointed. It was very strange to look at. Some states are abbreviated, others aren't -- seemingly at random.
